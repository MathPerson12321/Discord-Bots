#[Discord] - Pancake Grinder and More!</h1>

These are some templates to grind the Pancake bot and do more, adapt them to your liking! Just paste index.js in devtools, send a message, and then paste the code (make sure to adapt the fields).

Credits to rigwild for the index.js code (link is https://github.com/rigwild/discord-self-bot-console).

#What does each file do?

index.js sets everything up (by rigwild) with functions and allows easy discord API access. rigwild also made some starter projects to highlight what you can do, I have manipulated them to make 2 scripts. 

reaction.js simply reacts to every message in a channel (if you want to troll a server or just have it there) - this is mostly a test script.

pancakegrind.js is the grinder, so far it handles the "highlow" (always goes lower) and "work" commands (just grinds them) as of 2/15/25.
